I started my career as a web developer about **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2021} years ago**. I've tried some programming languages and tech stack, both Back-End, Mobile and Front-End.

Even though the scope of web development is broad, I was very interested and focused on **Front-End Development** and **Mobile Development**.

## Front-End Developer

I love creating something that is clean and minimalistic, attractive and has value, and of course, easy to use.

I really enjoy creating websites with **rich UI components**, including:

- **Web application**,
- **Documentation pages**,
- **Clean and Functional UI**,
- **Dashboard layout**,
- and others.

But I still like to make simple website pages like **landing pages**. So, what tools did I feel comfortable using during the website creation?

### TypeScript

First of all, the programming language. I'm very used to using **TypeScript**, although website creation can be done using PHP, Python, etc.

The JavaScript superset—TypeScript—has accompanied me for **about {new Date().getFullYear() - 2022} years**.

### React

I really enjoy building single page application websites and React is my go-to library.

I've been using it **since 2022 ({2025 - 2022} years)** and have become quite proficient with it.

### Next.js

Single-page websites are my thing, and Next.js is like my magic wand. Been building with it since 2022, and things are getting pretty cool! I love how it combines React with server-side rendering and static site generation to create blazing fast web applications.

### Tailwind CSS

For now, I love using Tailwind CSS for styling, even though I've been using SCSS for a longer time ({2020 - 2016} years).

**I'm really comfortable** using it and I think it's a great tool.

### Framer Motion

For animations, I am more comfortable using Framer Motion. Creating animations using JavaScript has **never been as easy as using Framer Motion**.

## Mobile Developer

I specialize in mobile app development using React Native and have been building cross-platform mobile applications **since 2023 ({new Date().getFullYear() - 2023} years)**.

I focus on creating performant and user-friendly mobile experiences that work seamlessly across both iOS and Android platforms. React Native allows me to build native mobile apps using my React and JavaScript expertise.

The most exciting challenge is optimizing app performance while maintaining a smooth, native feel and ensuring consistent behavior across different devices and operating systems.
